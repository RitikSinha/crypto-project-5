This landing page was for practice as it was just a landing page of a Crypto Landing Page. This was made with purely HTML and CSS. I learned about CSS selectors and poisoning. It is a non-responsive landing page. It took around 45 minutes to build this. The challenge was to turn the design into code. please take a look and give feedback. <br>
